FREE STUFF FOR EVERYONE

An experiment determining if bits can be liberated from commerce in the age of immersive computing

The Free Store is built using Mozilla's A-Frame javascript framework, assets created by the pallendrome liooil, with assets found online on sites like thingiverse, sketchfab, turbosquid, etc.. 

Everything in the free store links to a project free to download, as expected- the project is still in early alpha, but please let me know if there are any issues.
